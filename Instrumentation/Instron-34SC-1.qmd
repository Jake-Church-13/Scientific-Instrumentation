# Description

The Instron 34SC-1 Universal Testing System is a single-column, electromechanical testing machine designed for low-force mechanical testing applications, offering precision, reliability, and versatility. Part of Instron’s 3400 Series, it has a force capacity of up to 1 kN (1000 N or approximately 225 lbf), making it ideal for tensile, compression, flexure, peel, puncture, friction, and shear tests on a wide range of materials, including plastics, textiles, biomaterials, thin films, and small components. 

The 34SC-1 is equipped with a 1000 N load cell, a 1000 N crosshead, and a 1000 N pneumatic side-action grip, and is controlled by Instron’s Bluehill Universal software, which allows for easy test setup, data acquisition, and analysis. The system is also equipped with a video extensometer for non-contact strain measurement, and a temperature chamber for testing at controlled temperatures.
