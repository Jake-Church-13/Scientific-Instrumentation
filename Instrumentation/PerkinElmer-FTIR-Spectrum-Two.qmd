## Description

The PerkinElmer Spectrum Two is a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer developed for analytical applications in laboratory and field settings. Introduced in the early 2010s, this benchtop instrument is characterized by its compact design and portability. The device employs interferometric measurement techniques to capture infrared absorption spectra, which can identify molecular components in various samples.

The instrument is commonly used in academic research, quality control laboratories, and industrial settings for applications including polymer analysis, material identification, pharmaceutical composition verification, and environmental testing. Its design incorporates features intended to minimize maintenance requirements, including pre-aligned optical components and environmental protection systems.
