## Description

The YSI EXO1 Multiparameter Sonde is a compact, high-performance water quality monitoring instrument designed for estuarine, surface water, and groundwater applications. Featuring four universal sensor ports, the EXO1 supports a range of titanium smart sensors for parameters like temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total algae, and fDOM. Its rugged, wet-mateable connectors and welded titanium components ensure durability in harsh environments, while built-in antifouling systems, including optional wiper technology, maintain data integrity during long-term deployments.
