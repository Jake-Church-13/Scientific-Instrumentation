## Description

The Molecular Devices SpectraMax iD3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader is a versatile, high-performance instrument designed for a wide range of laboratory applications in life sciences research. It offers three primary detection modes: absorbance, fluorescence, and luminescence ,making it suitable for assays such as ELISAs, nucleic acid and protein quantification, and microbial growth studies. The iD3 is equipped with a large, high-resolution touchscreen interface, allowing users to set up custom protocols, run experiments, and access preconfigured protocols without needing a dedicated computer workstation. Its built-in near-field communication (NFC) functionality enables personalized workflows, letting users tap NFC tags to quickly access custom protocols and results, which is particularly useful in multi-user labs.
The optical system of the SpectraMax iD3 features a xenon flash lamp and an ultra-cooled photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector, which reduces background noise to provide excellent sensitivity and a wide dynamic range. This makes it ideal for demanding applications requiring high precision. The instrument supports flexible temperature control, adjustable from ambient up to 66°C, enabling temperature-sensitive assays. It also includes the QuickSync feature, which pushes data to any computer on the same network in an Excel-compatible format, streamlining data management. The iD3 is compatible with 6- to 384-well microplate formats and offers orbital shaking for uniform sample mixing.
Powered by Molecular Devices’ industry-leading SoftMax Pro Software, the iD3 provides over 160 ready-to-run protocols, advanced data analysis tools, and 21 curve-fit options. For regulated environments, the SoftMax Pro GxP Compliance Software ensures compliance with FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and EudraLex Annex 11, offering secure data integrity for GMP/GLP labs. The instrument is modular and upgradeable, with options to expand capabilities for additional assays, though it does not include advanced modes like TR-FRET or BRET, which are available in the iD5 model.
